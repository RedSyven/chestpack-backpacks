• Chest slot full? Don't worry -  the Chestpack's still got your _back_! Since it's an offhand equipment, there's no need to sacrifice protection.

### Burden Mechanic
• Holding more than one loaded chestpack will burden players with their weight!

### Why a Datapack?
<br />
This project uses a datapack to ensure:
<br />
<br />
• No Mods Required ✅: Works on vanilla servers! Friends can join hassle-free. Once the datapack/mod is installed by the host, no client installations are needed.
<br />
<br />
• Compatability ✅: Will work with practically any mod!
<br />
<br />
• Lightweight ✅: Minimal performance impact compared to mods.
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, due to limitations of datapacks, there are a couple constraints:
<br />
<br />
<br />
• Creative Mode Pickup ⛔: Chest pickup does not work in Creative Mode. Players have to be in Survival.
<br />
<br />
• Model Alignment ⛔: Datapacks can’t fully customize entity models. Chestpack models are anchored to the arm; This means it won't align to the player's back during fast movement.
<br />
